I am a lecturer in the School of Information Technology, Deakin University (Burwood campus). I also hold an honorary fellow position in the School of Computing and Information Systems (CIS), The University of Melbourne. Prior to Deakin, I was a research fellow in the Schoolf of CIS at The University of Melbourne. I received my Bacholor, Master and PhD degrees from Jilin University, Tsinghua University and The University of Melbourne, respectively.

<!-- where I obtained my PhD degree in machine learning in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">James Bailey</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=MjgOHPYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Sudanthi Wijewickrema</a>.  -->

I are interested in the theory and applications of machine learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on adversarial machine learning, trustworthy machine learning, weakly supervised learning, deep learning, data privacy and AI Security.

<!-- <span style="color:rgb(19,0,238)">Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in collaborations on the following topics. </span>  -->

<!-- I have visited a few amazing research institues: National Institute of Informatics (Japan) hosted by Prof. Michael E. Houle, and RIKEN (Japan) hosted by Prof. Masashi Sugiyama. I am also fortunate to have collabarated with many highly respected researchers. -->
<!-- I am also fortunate to have collabarated with <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/" target="_blank">Prof. Sarah Erfani</a> (Melbourne University), <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/" target="_blank">Dr. Yisen Wang</a> (Tsinghua University), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HUYTC0gAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Feng Lu</a> (Beihang University), <a href="http://www.crystal-boli.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Bo Li</a> (UIUC), <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/" target="_blank"> Prof. Quanquan Gu</a> (UCLA), <a href="http://www.yugangjiang.info" target="_blank"> Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang</a> (Fudan University), and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/" target="_blank">Prof. Dawn Song</a> (UC Berkeley). -->
